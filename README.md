# 🕹 Hangman Game (Python)

This is a simple terminal-based Hangman game built with Python. It randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player tries to guess the word one letter at a time before running out of attempts. It's a great beginner project to understand loops, conditionals, strings, and basic game logic.

## 🚀 Features

- Random word selection
- Input validation for repeated or invalid guesses
- ASCII art to visualize the Hangman
- Tracks number of remaining attempts
- Terminal/console based interface
## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x

No third-party libraries are required.

## 📦 Installation

🎮 How to Play

The computer randomly picks a word.

You guess one letter at a time
If your guess is correct, the letter is revealed.

If your guess is wrong, a part of the hangman is drawn.

You win if you guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn.

You lose if you run out of guesses.
